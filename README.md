# SSR and CSR in Next.js Example

This repository demonstrates how to implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in a Next.js project. Next.js is a powerful framework for React applications that provides seamless support for both SSR and CSR. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of SSR and CSR in your Next.js project.

## Introduction

Next.js offers a flexible approach to rendering your React components on the server-side or client-side, depending on your application's needs. SSR helps improve SEO, initial page load times, and provides better accessibility for users. CSR, on the other hand, allows you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces, fetching data after the initial page load.

This repository contains a simple example Next.js project that demonstrates how to set up SSR and CSR. By exploring the code and following the instructions below, you'll learn how to harness the power of both rendering strategies in your own Next.js applications.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```
cd nextjs-ssr-csr-example
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering is a technique where the server generates the initial HTML with data populated, and the page is served to the client already rendered. This approach improves SEO and initial load times.

In this example project, you'll find a simple component called `SSRPage` inside the `pages/ssr.js` file. This component demonstrates how to use SSR with Next.js. The server-side rendered content will be visible when you access the `/ssr` route of the application.

## Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

Client-Side Rendering allows you to render pages on the client-side after the initial page load. This is useful for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

In the example project, you'll find a component called `CSRPage` inside the `pages/csr.js` file. This component demonstrates how to use CSR in Next.js. The client-side rendered content will be visible when you access the `/csr` route of the application.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to use both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in a Next.js project. This gives you the flexibility to choose the best rendering strategy for different parts of your application, optimizing performance and user experience.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different components to further understand the power of Next.js.
